# Wallpaper credits

Due to the way wallpapers are shared and reposted around the web, it's difficult
to find out who made the original images we use as wallpapers.
In my best effort to credit authors and with no intention of infringing artists'
rights, I tried to cite, credit and link below the creators of the images I use
as wallpapers for my PC and/or terminals.

Create a PR to add missing information, or an issue if there is a licensing problem.
