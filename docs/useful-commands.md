# Useful commands

Sometimes I don't use some commands or utilities for a long time to the point I even forget they exist, so this document aims to be a cheatsheet of commands I find useful.
Sorted alphabetically.

- `flock`: create locks from bash scripts easily
- `bluetoothctl` controls bluetooth from the command line
- `pactree --reverse package_name` List packages depending on _package_name_
